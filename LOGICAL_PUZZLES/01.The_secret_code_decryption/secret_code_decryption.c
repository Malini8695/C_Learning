/*1. The Secret Code Decryption

 * Scenario: "You've found an encrypted message, but the code is simple. 
 * Each letter in the message has been shifted by a certain number in the alphabet. 
 * Your task is to decrypt it."

 * Task: Write a C program that takes an encrypted message (using a Caesar cipher) and a shift value, 
 * then decrypts the message by shifting each character in the reverse direction.

 * Hint: Think about ASCII values, and how shifting works in a circular manner (e.g., shifting "z" to "a").

 * Example: Encrypted message: "Dpef!", Shift: 1 â†’ Decrypted message: "Code!"
